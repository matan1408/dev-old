        Brazil is the largest country in terms of area and population in South America, the sixth in terms of area and population in the world.<br>
        Brazil dominates a large area, between the center of the continent and the Atlantic Ocean; It is the easternmost country in the Americas.
         It borders ten countries - practically all South American countries, except Ecuador and Chile. In the south it is bordered by Uruguay,
          in the southwest by Argentina, in the west by Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru, in the northwest by Colombia, and in the north by Venezuela, 
          Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.<br>
          Brazil has fertile agricultural lands as well as vast rainforests, the most famous of which is the Amazon forest. 
          The exploitation of the country's natural resources and the extensive industrialization that developed there made Brazil a leading economic power in South America and a regional leader.
           Brazil's human development index is relatively high compared to its neighbors, despite the significant social gaps that exist between the strata of Brazilian society.<br>
           The country is named after the Brazil tree (Pau-Brazil), which grew abundantly there until the middle of the 16th century (now in danger of extinction);
            The first European settlers valued it as an important natural resource.
             The name of the tree is derived from the word "brasa" (brasa), which means "ember" in Portuguese, inspired by the orange-red shade of the heart of the Brazil tree trunk.<br>
             Brazil was originally a Portuguese colony, and the official language there is Portuguese,
             unlike most Latin American countries, where the main language is Spanish.
              While the Spanish Empire in America was divided among many countries, the unity of the Portuguese Empire in America was maintained under one huge country - Brazil.<hr>

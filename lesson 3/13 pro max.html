        <p>
            iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro stretch the limits of what is possible with advanced technology.
The A15 Bionic chip, the fastest smartphone chip, enables the operation of the most advanced and professional camera system ever on an iPhone,
 with three new cameras and macro photography on an iPhone for the first time.
Stainless steel design for resistance to abrasion and rust, and flat hard design that matches the matte glass on the back, 
in five spectacular finishes: Alpine Green, Graphite, Silver, Gold and Sierra Blue.
The brightest Super Retina XDR and ProMotion displays ever on an iPhone model.
 The ProMotion feature provides an optimized refresh rate that intelligently ramps up when you need smooth scrolling, beautiful video playback, and immersive gameplay.
iPhone 13 Pro features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display and iPhone 13 Pro Max features a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display.
You can use the iPhone 13 Pro for over an hour and a half longer than the iPhone 12 Pro, and over two and a half hours longer on the iPhone 13 Pro Max compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
The ultra-fast A15 Bionic chip powers a powerful new 6-core processor with 2 high-performance cores and 4 high-efficiency cores.
